In this post, we compare two competing investment strategies: growth and value. 
"Growth" compagnies are those expected to grow faster than the rest and generate big cash flows in the **future**. 
"Value" compagnies already sit on a mature market and generate stable cash flows.  
Let's see what lessons we can draw from the study of the two competing strategies. 

The graph below shows that, on the long term (~50 years), the two strategies give an equal result. 
However, on the short term, one strategy outperforms the other. For instance, growth outperformed in 1995-2000 whereas value outperformed in 2003-2007. And we can see growth has been outperforming recently.

Let's now quantify outperformance. The following graph shows the difference in annualized total returns between value and growth, over rolling 5-years windows. From 1995 to 2000, value underperformed growth by 14%/year on average. From 2000 to 2005, value catched up and outperformed growth by 16%/year on average.

Value underperformed growth by 6%/year over the last 10 years, and 13%/year over the last 3 years. 
The explanation for the triumph of growth in 2020 is twofold : 
* The COVID pandemic has forced people to stay home and switch all personal and professional activities online via Amazon, Zoom, Netflix, etc... And those are mega-cap growth compagnies. 
* Central banks have slashed interest rates to support the economy, and low interest rates favor growth compagnies because they increase the present value of future cash flows. 

Some investors argue growth still has an upward potential. 
But what risk does growth entails ? 
The last graph shows the distribution of positive returns (up) and negative returns (down) on rolling quarter periods for the two strategies. The stretched growth boxplots picture a higher volatility in both positive and negative periods. Hence, growth investing is inheritently more risky than value investing.

# Conclusion

Since january 2010, growth is up 510% and value is up 324%. 
While it's impossible to predict how long growth will continue to outperform value, the probability of a trend reversal is only increasing. It is also likely that the reversal will occur during the next global downtrends, because growth stocks are more exposed to sharp drawdowns than value stocks. 
Therefore, right now, value stocks look attractive to prudent investors who want to bet on the next 15 years.
